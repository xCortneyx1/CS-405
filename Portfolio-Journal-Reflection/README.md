# Portfolio Reflection

This folder contains my final portfolio journal reflection.

The reflection discusses:
- Adoption of secure coding standards
- Risk evaluation and cost-benefit analysis
- Zero trust implementation
- Security policy recommendations

This document summarizes how secure development principles were applied throughout the course.
