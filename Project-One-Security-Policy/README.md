# Project One – Secure Development Policy

This folder contains my formal Secure Development Policy created for CS-405.

The document includes:
- Ten Core Security Principles
- C/C++ Secure Coding Standards
- Risk Assessment Framework
- Encryption and AAA Policies
- Audit Controls and Enforcement Procedures

This project demonstrates policy development aligned with SEI CERT and defense-in-depth principles.
