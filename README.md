# CS-405 Secure Coding Portfolio  
**Cortney Messinger**  
Southern New Hampshire University  
Course: CS-405 Secure Coding  

---

## Course Overview

This repository contains artifacts demonstrating the application of secure software development principles, including secure coding standards, risk assessment, zero trust architecture, static code analysis, encryption implementation, and formal security policy development.

Throughout this course, I applied industry-recognized frameworks such as:

- SEI CERT C/C++ Secure Coding Standards
- OWASP Top 10 Risk Awareness
- Defense-in-Depth Principles
- Zero Trust Security Model
- Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment

## Repository Structure

### Project One – Secure Development Policy
Location: `/Project-One-Security-Policy/`

Contains a formal secure software development policy including:

- Ten Core Security Principles
- C/C++ Secure Coding Standards
- Risk Assessment Framework
- Encryption and AAA Policies
- Audit Controls and Enforcement Procedures

---

### Project Two – Security Presentation
Location: `/Project-Two-Presentation/`

Includes:

- Static Code Analysis Results (Visual Studio & Cppcheck)
- Encryption Implementation Summary
- Risk Evaluation
- Mitigation Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Security Recommendations

---

### Coding Artifacts
Location: `/Coding-Artifacts/`

Includes ZIP archives of:

- Module 4 – Exception Handling Implementation
- Module 5 – XOR Encryption Project
- Static Code Analysis Project
- Supporting C++ source files and Visual Studio solutions

All ZIP files exclude build artifacts and temporary files.

---

### Portfolio Reflection
Location: `/Portfolio-Journal-Reflection/`

Includes final journal reflection discussing:

- Adoption of Secure Coding Standards
- Integrating Security Early
- Risk and Cost-Benefit Evaluation
- Zero Trust Implementation
- Security Policy Governance

---

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Secure-by-Design Development
- Threat Modeling
- Defensive Programming in C++
- Static Code Analysis
- Encryption Implementation
- Risk-Based Decision Making
- Security Policy Authoring

---

## Summary

This portfolio reflects the integration of secure development principles across design, implementation, testing, and governance. Security was treated as a foundational requirement rather than an afterthought.
